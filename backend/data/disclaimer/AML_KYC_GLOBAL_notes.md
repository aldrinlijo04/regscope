# AML/KYC Global Standards - Implementation Notes

## Overview
International standards for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) based on Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, implemented globally through national legislation.

## Key Compliance Requirements

### 1. Customer Due Diligence (CDD)

- **Beneficial Ownership**: Identify ultimate beneficial owners (25%+ ownership)
- **Business Relationship**: Understand purpose and nature
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous transaction monitoring
- **Enhanced DD**: For high-risk customers

### 2. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)
- **PEPs**: Politically Exposed Persons require senior management approval
- **Source of Wealth**: Document and verify for high-risk customers
- **Source of Funds**: Verify origin of transaction funds
- **High-Risk Jurisdictions**: FATF blacklist/greylist countries
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increased transaction scrutiny

### 3. Transaction Monitoring
- **Automated Systems**: Real-time monitoring platforms
- **Scenarios**: Unusual patterns, structuring, rapid movement
- **Sanctions Screening**: OFAC, UN, EU lists
- **Alert Generation**: For manual compliance review
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Large cash transactions

### 4. Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)
- **Timing**: Prompt reporting when suspicion arises
- **FIU**: File with Financial Intelligence Unit
